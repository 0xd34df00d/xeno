# xeno

A WIP XML parser in pure Haskell.

The [hexml](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hexml) Haskell library uses
an XML parser written in C, so that is the baseline we're trying to
beat or match roughly.

Current implementation:

* It currently doesn't return a result.
* It does not process attributes yet.
* It walks across a string looking for tags, non-hierarchically
  (i.e. doesn't check closing tags).
* It handles comments.
* It runs in constant or practically constant space (see the memory
  benchmarks below).
* It currently is faster than Hexml.

Memory benchmarks for Xeno:

    Case        Bytes  GCs  Check
    4kb parse   1,160    0  OK
    42kb parse  1,160    0  OK
    52kb parse  1,160    0  OK
